# IVOA RofR
This directory contains the IVOA Registry of Registries project.

## Description
The `ivoa-rofr` consists of a number of modules.  These modules are deployed across an HTTP server, a Java Servlet container, and assorted scripts and applications used as CGIs.  The modules are listed below:

### Repository_Explorer-2.0-1.46
C applications which provides OAI validation.  This application was developed externally; it is used to validate a registry's compliance to the base OAI-PMH protocol.  

### adql-1.0
Java library which provides ADQL V1.0 parsing functionality.  ADLQ library is used by ivoaregistry to parse ADQL queries in compliance with the Registry 1.0 standard.    

### dalvalidate
Java servlets and library that provides validation.  In addition to providing validators for individual IVOA service types, it provides the base validation framework upon which the validator within ivoaharvest is based.  

### ivoaharvest
Java servlets that provide validation.  Depends upon dalvalidate module.  This package will harvest VOResource records according to the recipe layed out in the Registry standard, and it will validate the registry interfaces.  

### ivoaregistry
Java library that provides a client interface to searchable registries.  (This does not include the RegTAP interface.)

### junx-master
Java library which provides XML validation.

### rofrtar
Final packaging of the ivoa-rofr application to be deployed on the HTTP server.

## Configuration
Configuration parameters are listed in the top stanza of ./deploy_env.properties.

rofr.base.url
       Base URL of the ivoa-rofr on the HTTP server.  

rofr.email
       Email contact for ivoa-rofr questions.

rofr.home.dir
       Installation directory of the ivoa-rofr project on the HTTP server.

## Building
After the ivoa-rofr has been configured for the environment in which it will be deployed, run the following:

```shell
$ ant install
```

This will compile, test, package, and install on your local repository the various components of the ivoa-rofr.

## Installing
See below for 
1. Deploy/configure to Apache HTTPD Server
2. Deploy to Apache Tomcat Server

## Deploy/configure to Apache HTTPD Server
1. Copy `ivoa-rofr.tar` from the local Ivy repository, `~/.ivy2/local/nvo/ivoa-rofr/<VERSION>/tars/ivoa-rofr.tar` to the parent directory of `rofr.home.dir` on the HTTP server host.  
1. Untar the `ivoa-rofr.tar`. 
1. Set IVOA_ROFR_HOME environment variable to the value of rofr.home.dir.
1. Edit the Apache HTTP server configuration to support ivoa-rofr requirements.  See `httpd.conf` below.
1. Copy the workers.properties file to the Apache HTTP server configuration directory.
    1. `$ cp ~/.ivy2/local/nvo/ivoa-rofr/1.0/tars/ivoa-rofr.tar /home/rofr/pkgs/`
    1. `$ cd /home/rofr/pkgs`
       `$ gtar xf ivoa-rofr.tar`
    1. `$ setenv IVOA_ROFR_HOME /home/rofr/pkgs`
    1. Edit existing `$HTTPD_HOME/conf/httpd.conf` files as necessary
    1. `$ cp $IVOA_ROFR_HOME/apache_conf/workers.properties $HTTPD_HOME/conf`

### httpd.conf
A sample `http.conf` file is provided in the apache_conf subdirectory.  Alternatively, the modifications to the default httpd.conf 
file required by ivoa-rofr are outlined below:

* Ensure the following LoadModule directives are present and uncommented.
```
LoadModule rewrite_module mod_rewrite.so
LoadModule jk_module mod_jk.so
```
* Following the Module directives add JK Module directives
```
JkWorkersFile conf/workers.properties
JkShmFile logs/mod_jk.shm
JkLogFile logs/mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel info
JkLogStampFormat "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] "
```
* Add a VirtualHost directive
```xml 
<VirtualHost *:8090>
   ServerName      newdevel7.cfa.harvard.edu
   ServerAlias     newdevel7.cfa.harvard.edu
   ServerAdmin     mtibbetts@cfa.harvard.edu
   DocumentRoot    ${IVOA_ROFR_HOME}/html
   DirectoryIndex  index.html
   ScriptAlias     /cgi-bin/ "${IVOA_ROFR_HOME}/cgi-bin/"
   ErrorLog        ${IVOA_ROFR_HOME}/var/logs/error_log
   CustomLog       ${IVOA_ROFR_HOME}/var/logs/access_log combined
   JkMount         /regvalidate* rofr
   
   RewriteEngine   On
   RewriteOptions  Inherit
   RewriteRule ^/rofr/(.*) /$1
   RewriteRule ^/cgi-bin/rofr/(.*) /cgi-bin/$1
   RewriteRule ^/VO/services/(cs|sia)validate.html http://newdevel7.cfa.harvard.edu:8090/dalvalidate/$1validate.html [L,R=301]
</VirtualHost>
```
* Add the following Directory directive to make the ivoa-rofr html directory accessible to the httpd server.
```xml
<Directory "${IVOA_ROFR_HOME}/html">
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride All
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```
* Add the following Directory directive to make the ivoa-rofr cgi-bin directory accessible to the httpd server.
```xml 
<Directory "${IVOA_ROFR_HOME}/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options FollowSymLinks
    Require all granted
</Directory>
```

## Deploy to Apache Tomcat Server
`$ scp ~/.ivy2/local/nvo/ivoaharvest/1.0/wars/regvalidate.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps`
