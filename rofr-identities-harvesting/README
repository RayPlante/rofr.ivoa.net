This is a standalone console Java application that "harvests"
registry records and saves them as files in the local file
system (optionally pretty-printing them along the way). The
verb "harvests" is in quotes as the application is not, actually
using the OAI-PMH procedure technically known as "harvesting".
I.e. it is not using the 'verb=listRecords' endpoint. Instead, for
each registry, it uses the 'verb=Identify' endpoint so this is not
really harvesting in the OAI-PMH sense of the word. It simply
fetches (for each registry) the vg:Registry resource that describes
it. It is these records that we then use to populate the RofR.

To generate the uber-jar for the Java console application
simply type 'ant' at the top level. This is the recommended
way and prints a nice informative message letting you know where
the uber-jar is located.

Alternatively, 'cd' into the 'main/' directory and type:

    $ ant package-uberjar

'ant clean' at the top level cleans everything.

To see the integrated help, invoke the uber-jar with the '-h'
option:

java -jar target/rofr-identities-harvesting-uber.jar -h

... or with no option at all.
